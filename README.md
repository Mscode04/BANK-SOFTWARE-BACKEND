ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:
I would like to acknowledge the contributions of the MySQL Connector/Python library, which enabled seamless interaction between Python and MySQL databases. Additionally, I extend gratitude to the open-source community for providing valuable resources and support throughout the development process.

EXPLANATION:
This project leverages the power of Python programming language and MySQL database to create a robust banking system. Users interact with the system through a menu-driven interface, where they can choose from a range of banking operations. The system ensures security by implementing PIN-based authentication for account access. It also maintains transaction records for auditing purposes and facilitates employee management, including attendance tracking and adding new employees to the system.

ADVANTAGES:
1. User-Friendly Interface: The menu-driven interface simplifies the banking process for both customers and employees, enhancing user experience.
2. Comprehensive Functionality: The system covers a wide range of banking operations, from account management to transaction handling, providing a comprehensive solution for banking needs.
3. Secure Authentication: PIN-based authentication ensures secure access to accounts, safeguarding customer information and transactions.
4. Efficient Database Management: MySQL database efficiently manages and stores account details, transaction records, and employee information, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
5. Scalability: The modular design of the system allows for easy scalability, enabling future enhancements and additions to meet evolving business requirement
